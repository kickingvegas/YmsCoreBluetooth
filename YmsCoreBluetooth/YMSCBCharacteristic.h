 Set notification value of cbCharacteristic.
 
 When notifyValue is YES, then cbCharacterisic is set to notify upon any changes to its value. 
 When notifyValue is NO, then no notifications are sent.
 
 An implementation of the method [YMSCBService notifyCharacteristicHandler:error:] is used to handle
 updates to cbCharacteristic. Note that notification handling is done at the YMSCBService level via 
 method handler and not by callback blocks. The reason for this is opinion: It is more convenient to
 write a method handler to deal with non-deterministic, asynchronous notification events than it is with blocks.
