/**
 Base class for defining a Bluetooth LE central.
 
 YMSCBCentralManager holds an instance of CBCentralManager (manager) and implements the
 CBCentralManagerDelgate messages sent by manager.
 
 This class provides ObjectiveC block-based callback support for peripheral
 scanning and retrieval.
 
 YMSCBCentralManager is intended to be subclassed: the subclass would in turn be written to 
 handle the set of BLE peripherals of interest to the application.
 
 The subclass is typically implemented (though not necessarily) as a singleton, so that there 
 is only one instance of CBCentralManager that is used by the application.

 All discovered BLE peripherals are stored in the array ymsPeripherals.

 Legacy Note: This class was previously named YMSCBAppService.
