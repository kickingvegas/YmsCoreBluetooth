# YmsCoreBluetooth v1.09
A block-based framework for building Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (aka Smart or LE) iOS 7 or OS X 10.9 applications using the CoreBluetooth API. Includes *Deanna* and *DeannaMac*, applications to communicate with a [TI SensorTag](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag) for iOS and OS X respectively.

* [YmsCoreBluetooth API Reference](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/index.html)

## YmsCoreBluetooth Design Intent: Or Why You Want To Use This Framework
### tl;dr 
* ObjectiveC Block-based API for Bluetooth LE communication.
* Operations (e.g. scanning, retrieval, connection, reads, writes) map to the data object hierarchy of CoreBluetooth.
* You can build apps using CoreBluetooth [faster](http://yummymelon.com/ymsblog/sensortag-remote-control-for-itunes.html).

### A More Detailed Explanation

#### Blocks are cool.
Transactions in Bluetooth LE (BLE) are two-phase (request-response) in nature: CoreBluetooth abstracts this protocol so that request behavior is separated from response behavior. The two phases are reconciled using a delegation pattern: the object initiating the request phase has a delegate object with a delegate method to handle the corresponding response phase. While functional, the delegation pattern can be cumbersome to use because the behavior for a two-phase transaction is split into two different locations in code.

A more convenient programming pattern is to use a callback block which is defined with the request. When the response is received, the callback block can be executed to handle it. *The design intent of YmsCoreBluetooth is use Objective-C blocks to define response behavior to BLE requests*. Such requests include:

* scanning and/or retrieving peripheral(s)
* connecting to a peripheral
* discovering a peripheral's services
* discovering a service's characteristics
* write and read of a characteristic
* setting the notification status of a characteristic

#### Hierarchical operations are cool.
The data object hierachy of CoreBluetooth can be described as such:

* A CBCentralManager instance can connect to multiple CBPeripheral instances.
    * A CBPeripheral instance can have multiple CBService instances.
	    * A CBService instance can have multiple CBCharacteristic instances.
		    * A CBCharacteristic instance can have multiple CBDescriptor instances.
			
However the existing CoreBluetooth API does not map BLE requests to the data object hierarchy. For example connection to a CBPeripheral instance is accomplished from a CBCentralManager instance instead of from a CBPeripheral. Writes, reads, and setting the notification state of a CBCharacteristic are issued from a CBPeripheral instance, instead of from CBCharacteristic. *YmsCoreBluetooth provides an API that more naturally maps operations to the data object hierarchy*.

YMSCoreBluetooth defines container classes which map to the CoreBluetooth object hierarchy:

* YMSCBCentralManager - Contains a CBCentralManager instance.
    * YMSCBPeripheral - Contains a CBPeripheral instance.
        * YMSCBService - Contains a CBService instance.
             * YMSCBCharacteristic - Contains a CBCharacteristic instance.
			     * YMSCBDescriptor - Contains a CBDescriptor instance.

However, they differ from CoreBluetooth in that operations are done with respect to the object type:

* YMSCBCentralManager
  - scans for peripherals
  - retrieves peripherals
* YMSCBPeripheral
  - connects and disconnects to central
  - discovers services associated with this peripheral
* YMSCBService
  - discovers characteristics associated with this service
  - handles notification updates for characteristics which are set to notify
* YMSCBCharacteristic
  - set notification status (on, off)
  - write value to characteristic
  - read value of characteristic
  - discover descriptors associated with this characteristic 
* YMSCBDescriptor
  - write value to descriptor
  - read value of descriptor

### Deanna and DeannaMac

The apps **Deanna** and **DeannaMac** are demonstration apps intended to illustrate the use of *YmsCoreBluetooth*. Both apps use *YmsCoreBluetooth* to characterize a TI SensorTag and provide controllability and observability of the six sensors on the device. It also has the capability to scan for other BLE devices.

*Deanna* has been recently changed (v 0.943) to support the graphic design contributions of [Wayne Dahlberg](http://waynedahlberg.com). 

### Show Code
#### Scanning for Peripherals

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBCentralManager.

    __weak YMSCBCentralManager *this = self;
    [self scanForPeripheralsWithServices:nil
                                 options:options
                               withBlock:^(CBPeripheral *peripheral, NSDictionary *advertisementData, NSNumber *RSSI, NSError *error) {
                                   if (error) {
                                       NSLog(@"Something bad happened with scanForPeripheralWithServices:options:withBlock:");
                                       return;
                                   }
                                   
                                   NSLog(@"DISCOVERED: %@, %@, %@ db", peripheral, peripheral.name, RSSI);
                                   [this handleFoundPeripheral:peripheral];
                               }];

#### Retrieving Peripherals

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBCentralManager and `identifiers` is an array of `NSUUID` instances that map to a peripheral that has been discovered by the iOS device.

    [self retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers:identifiers];


*Note* - This API has changed for iOS7 due to the deprecation of [YMSCBCentralManager retrievePeripherals:withBlock:]

    // I AM OLD CODE. 
    __weak DEACentralManager *this = self;
    [self retrievePeripherals:peripheralUUIDs
                    withBlock:^(CBPeripheral *peripheral) {
                        [this handleFoundPeripheral:peripheral];
                    }];
  
  
#### Connecting to a Peripheral

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBPeripheral. Note that in the callbacks, discovering services and characteristics are handled in a nested fashion:

    - (void)connect {
        // Watchdog aware method
        [self resetWatchdog];

        [self connectWithOptions:nil withBlock:^(YMSCBPeripheral *yp, NSError *error) {
            if (error) {
                return;
            }

            // Example where only a subset of services is to be discovered.
            //[yp discoverServices:[yp servicesSubset:@[@"temperature", @"simplekeys", @"devinfo"]] withBlock:^(NSArray *yservices, NSError *error) {

            [yp discoverServices:[yp services] withBlock:^(NSArray *yservices, NSError *error) {
                if (error) {
                    return;
                }

                for (YMSCBService *service in yservices) {
                    if ([service.name isEqualToString:@"simplekeys"]) {
                        __weak DEASimpleKeysService *thisService = (DEASimpleKeysService *)service;
                        [service discoverCharacteristics:[service characteristics] withBlock:^(NSDictionary *chDict, NSError *error) {
                            [thisService turnOn];
                        }];

                    } else if ([service.name isEqualToString:@"devinfo"]) {
                        __weak DEADeviceInfoService *thisService = (DEADeviceInfoService *)service;
                        [service discoverCharacteristics:[service characteristics] withBlock:^(NSDictionary *chDict, NSError *error) {
                            [thisService readDeviceInfo];
                        }];

                    } else {
                        __weak DEABaseService *thisService = (DEABaseService *)service;
                        [service discoverCharacteristics:[service characteristics] withBlock:^(NSDictionary *chDict, NSError *error) {
                            for (NSString *key in chDict) {
                                YMSCBCharacteristic *ct = chDict[key];
                                //NSLog(@"%@ %@ %@", ct, ct.cbCharacteristic, ct.uuid);

                                [ct discoverDescriptorsWithBlock:^(NSArray *ydescriptors, NSError *error) {
                                    if (error) {
                                        return;
                                    }
                                    for (YMSCBDescriptor *yd in ydescriptors) {
                                        NSLog(@"Descriptor: %@ %@ %@", thisService.name, yd.UUID, yd.cbDescriptor);
                                    }
                                }];
                            }
                        }];
                    }
                }
            }];
        }];
    }


#### Read a Characteristic

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBService. All discovered characteristics are stored in [YMSCBService characteristicDict].

	- (void)readDeviceInfo {

		YMSCBCharacteristic *system_idCt = self.characteristicDict[@"system_id"];
		__weak DEADeviceInfoService *this = self;
		[system_idCt readValueWithBlock:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {
			NSMutableString *tmpString = [NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@""];
			unsigned char bytes[data.length];
			[data getBytes:bytes];
			for (int ii = (int)data.length; ii >= 0;ii--) {
				[tmpString appendFormat:@"%02hhx",bytes[ii]];
				if (ii) {
					[tmpString appendFormat:@":"];
				}
			}

			NSLog(@"system id: %@", tmpString);
			_YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD(^{
				this.system_id = tmpString;
			});

		}];

		YMSCBCharacteristic *model_numberCt = self.characteristicDict[@"model_number"];
		[model_numberCt readValueWithBlock:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {
			if (error) {
				NSLog(@"ERROR: %@", error);
				return;
			}

			NSString *payload = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSStringEncodingConversionAllowLossy];
			NSLog(@"model number: %@", payload);
			_YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD(^{
				this.model_number = payload;
			});
		}];
	}


#### Write to a Characteristic

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBService. In this example, a write to the 'config' characteristic followed by a read of the 'calibration' characteristic is done.

	- (void)requestCalibration {
		if (self.isCalibrating == NO) {

			__weak DEABarometerService *this = self;

			YMSCBCharacteristic *configCt = self.characteristicDict[@"config"];
			[configCt writeByte:0x2 withBlock:^(NSError *error) {
				if (error) {
					NSLog(@"ERROR: write request to barometer config to start calibration failed.");
					return;
				}

				YMSCBCharacteristic *calibrationCt = this.characteristicDict[@"calibration"];
				[calibrationCt readValueWithBlock:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {
					if (error) {
						NSLog(@"ERROR: read request to barometer calibration failed.");
						return;
					}

					this.isCalibrating = NO;
					char val[data.length];
					[data getBytes:&val length:data.length];

					int i = 0;
					while (i < data.length) {
						uint16_t lo = val[i];
						uint16_t hi = val[i+1];
						uint16_t cx = ((lo & 0xff)| ((hi << 8) & 0xff00));
						int index = i/2 + 1;

						if (index == 1) self.c1 = cx;
						else if (index == 2) this.c2 = cx;
						else if (index == 3) this.c3 = cx;
						else if (index == 4) this.c4 = cx;
						else if (index == 5) this.c5 = cx;
						else if (index == 6) this.c6 = cx;
						else if (index == 7) this.c7 = cx;
						else if (index == 8) this.c8 = cx;

						i = i + 2;
					}

					this.isCalibrating = YES;
					this.isCalibrated = YES;

				}];
			}];

		}
	}


### Handling Characteristic Notification Updates

One place where YmsCoreBluetooth does *not* use blocks to handle BLE responses is with characteristic notification updates. The reason for this is because such updates are asynchronous and non-deterministic. As such the handler method `[YMSCBService notifyCharacteristicHandler:error:]` must be implemented for any subclass of YMSCBService to handle such updates.

In the following code sample, `self` is an instance of a subclass of YMSCBService.

	- (void)turnOn {
		__weak DEABaseService *this = self;

		YMSCBCharacteristic *configCt = self.characteristicDict[@"config"];
		[configCt writeByte:0x1 withBlock:^(NSError *error) {
			if (error) {
				NSLog(@"ERROR: %@", error);
				return;
			}

			NSLog(@"TURNED ON: %@", this.name);
		}];

		YMSCBCharacteristic *dataCt = self.characteristicDict[@"data"];
		[dataCt setNotifyValue:YES withBlock:^(NSError *error) {
			NSLog(@"Data notification for %@ on", this.name);
		}];


		_YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD(^{
			this.isOn = YES;
		});
	}

	- (void)notifyCharacteristicHandler:(YMSCBCharacteristic *)yc error:(NSError *)error {
		if (error) {
			return;
		}

		if ([yc.name isEqualToString:@"data"]) {
			NSData *data = yc.cbCharacteristic.value;

			char val[data.length];
			[data getBytes:&val length:data.length];

			int16_t v0 = val[0];
			int16_t v1 = val[1];
			int16_t v2 = val[2];
			int16_t v3 = val[3];

			int16_t amb = ((v2 & 0xff)| ((v3 << 8) & 0xff00));
			int16_t objT = ((v0 & 0xff)| ((v1 << 8) & 0xff00));

			double tempAmb = calcTmpLocal(amb);

			__weak DEATemperatureService *this = self;
			_YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD(^{
				this.ambientTemp = @(tempAmb);
				this.objectTemp = @(calcTmpTarget(objT, tempAmb));
			});
		}
	}


**Important**: To let the UI components in the main thread know via KVO that a property has changed, you must update that property on the main thread. A convenience macro `_YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD` which uses the GCD call `dispatch_async()` does just that:

	#define _YMS_PERFORM_ON_MAIN_THREAD(block) dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), block);


### Block Callback Design

The callback pattern used by YmsCoreBluetooth uses a single callback to handle both successfull and failed responses. This is accomplished by including an `error` parameter. If an `error` object is not `nil`, then behavior to handle the failure can be implemented. Otherwise behavior to handle success is implemented.

	^(NSError *error) {
	   if (error) {
		  // Code to handle failure
		  return;
	   }
	   // Code to handle success
	}


## File Naming Conventions
The YmsCoreBluetooth framework is the set of files prefixed with `YMSCB` located in the directory `YmsCoreBluetooth`.

The files for the iOS application **Deanna** are prefixed with `DEA` and are located in the directory `Deanna`.

The files for the OS X application **DeannaMac** are prefixed with `DEM` and are located in the directory `DeannaMac`.

## Recommended Code Walk Through

To better understand how YmsCoreBluetooth works, it is recommended to first read the source of the following BLE service implementations:

* DEAAccelerometerService, DEABarometerService, DEAGyroscopeService, DEAHumidityService, DEAMagnetometerService, DEASimpleKeysService, DEATemperatureService, DEADeviceInfoService

Then the BLE peripheral implementation of the TI SensorTag:

* DEASensorTag

Then the application service which manages all known peripherals:

* DEACentralManager

The [Class Hierarchy](http://kickingvegas.github.io/YmsCoreBluetooth/appledoc/hierarchy.html) is very instructive in showing the relationship of the above classes to the YmsCoreBluetooth framework.
